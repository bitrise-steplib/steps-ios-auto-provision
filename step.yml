title: iOS Auto Provision with Apple ID (Deprecated)
summary: Automatically manages your iOS Provisioning Profiles for your Xcode project.
description: |-
  ### This Step has been deprecated in favour of the new automatic code signing options on Bitrise.
  You can read more about these changes in our blog post: [https://blog.bitrise.io/post/simplifying-automatic-code-signing-on-bitrise](https://blog.bitrise.io/post/simplifying-automatic-code-signing-on-bitrise).

  #### Option A)
  The latest versions of the [Xcode Archive & Export for iOS](https://www.bitrise.io/integrations/steps/xcode-archive), [Xcode Build for testing for iOS](https://www.bitrise.io/integrations/steps/xcode-build-for-test), and the [Export iOS and tvOS Xcode archive](https://www.bitrise.io/integrations/steps/xcode-archive) Steps have built-in automatic code signing.
  We recommend removing this Step from your Workflow and using the automatic code signing feature in the Steps mentioned above.

  #### Option B)
  If you are not using any of the mentioned Xcode Steps, then you can replace
  this iOS Auto Provision Step with the [Manage iOS Code signing](https://www.bitrise.io/integrations/steps/manage-ios-code-signing) Step.

  ### Description
  The [Step](https://devcenter.bitrise.io/getting-started/configuring-bitrise-steps-that-require-apple-developer-account-data/#ios-auto-provision-with-apple-id-step) uses session-based authentication to connect to an Apple Developer account. In addition to an Apple ID and password, it also stores the 2-factor authentication (2FA) code you provide.

  Please note that the [iOS Auto Provision with App Store Connect API](https://app.bitrise.io/integrations/steps/ios-auto-provision-appstoreconnect) Step uses the official [App Store Connect API](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appstoreconnectapi/generating_tokens_for_api_requests) instead of the old session-based method.

  The **iOS Auto Provision with Apple ID** Step supports in Xcode managed and manual code signing in the following ways:

  In the case of Xcode managed code signing projects, the Step:
  - Downloads the Xcode managed Provisioning Profiles and installs them for the build.
  - Installs the provided code signing certificates into the Keychain.
  In the case of manual code signing projects, the Step:
  - Ensures that the Application Identifier exists on the Apple Developer Portal.
  - Ensures that the project's Capabilities are set correctly in the Application Identifier.
  - Ensures that the Provisioning Profiles exist on the Apple Developer Portal and are installed for the build.
  - Ensures that all the available Test Devices exist on the Apple Developer Portal and are included in the Provisioning Profiles.
  - Installs the provided code signing certificates into the Keychain.

  ### Configuring the Step

  Before you start configuring the Step, make sure you've completed the following requirements:
  - You've [defining your Apple Developer Account to Bitrise](https://devcenter.bitrise.io/getting-started/configuring-bitrise-steps-that-require-apple-developer-account-data/#defining-your-apple-developer-account-to-bitrise-1).
  - You've [assigned an Apple Developer Account for your app](https://devcenter.bitrise.io/getting-started/configuring-bitrise-steps-that-require-apple-developer-account-data/#assigning-an-apple-developer-account-for-your-app-1).

  To configure the Step:
  Once you've completed the above requirements, there is very little configuration needed to this Step.
  1. Add the **iOS Auto Provision with Apple ID** Step after any dependency installer Step in your Workflow, such as **Run CocoaPods install** or **Carthage**.
  2. Click the Step to edit its input fields. You can see that the **Distribution type**, **Xcode Project (or Workspace) path**, and the **Scheme name** inputs are automatically filled out for you.
  3. If your Developer Portal Account belongs to multiple development teams, add the **Developer Portal team ID** to manage the project's code signing files, for example '1MZX23ABCD4'. If that's not the case, you can still add it to manage the Provisioning Profiles with a different team than the one set in your project. If you leave it empty, the team defined by the project will be used.
  4. If you wish to overwrite the configuration defined in your Scheme (for example, Debug, Release), you can do so in the **Configuration name** input.
  5. If Xcode managed signing is enabled in the iOS app, check the value of the **Should the step try to generate Provisioning Profiles even if Xcode managed signing is enabled in the Xcode project?** input.
  - If it’s set to 'no', the Step will look for an Xcode Managed Provisioning Profile on the Apple Developer Portal.
  - If it’s set to 'yes', the Step will generate a new manual provisioning profile on the Apple Developer portal for the project.
  This input has no effect in the case of Manual code signing projects.
  6. **The minimum days the Provisioning Profile should be valid** lets you specify how long a Provisioning Profile should be valid to sign an iOS app. By default it will only renew the Provisioning Profile when it expires.

  ### Troubleshooting
  Please note that the 2FA code is only valid for 30 days. 
  When the 2FA code expires, you will need to re-authenticate to provide a new code. 
  Go to the Apple Developer Account of the **Account settings** page, it will automatically ask for the 2FA code to authenticate again. 
  There will be a list of the Apple Developer accounts that you have defined. To the far right of each, there are 3 dots. 
  Click the dots and select **Re-authenticate (2SA/2FA)**.

      By default (0) it just renews the Provisioning Profile when expired.
