  Automatically manages your iOS Provisioning Profiles for your Xcode project:

  - it ensures that the Application Identifier exists on the Apple Developer Portal
  - it ensures that the project's Capabilities are set correctly in the Application Identifier
  - it ensures that the Provisioning Profiles exists on the Apple Developer Portal
  - it ensure that all the available Test Devices exists on the Apple Developer Portal and are included in the Provisioning Profile as well
  - it installs all the Codesigning Certificates into the Keychain

      URLs of the certificates to download.

      Multiple URLs can be specified, separated by a pipe (`|`) character.

      You can specify a local path as well, using the `file://` scheme.

      Provide a development certificate url, to ensure development code sign files for the project and also provide a distribution certificate url, to ensure distribution code sign files for your project.

      Example: 

      `file://./development/certificate/path|https://distribution/certificate/url`
    is_required: true
- passphrases: $BITRISE_CERTIFICATE_PASSPHRASE
  opts:
    title: "Certificate passphrase"
    description: |
      Certificate passphrases.

      Multiple passphrases can be specified, separated by a pipe (`|`) character.

      Specified certificate passphrase count should match the count of the certificate urls.

      example: development certificate with empty passphrase, distribution certificate with non-empty passphrase

      ```
      passphrases: "|distribution-passphrase"
      ```

      If you leave it empty the project defined team will be used.
