  Automatically manages your iOS Provisioning Profiles for your Xcode project:

  - it ensures that the Application Identifier exists on the Apple Developer Portal
  - it ensures that the project's Capabilities are set correctly in the Application Identifier
  - it ensures that the Provisioning Profiles exists on the Apple Developer Portal
  - it ensure that all the available Test Devices exists on the Apple Developer Portal and are included in the Provisioning Profile as well
  - it installs all the Codesigning Certificates into the Keychain

      The Developer Portal team to manage the project's code signing files.

      __If your Developer Portal Account belongs to multiple development team, this input is required!__ Otherwise specify this input if you want to manage the Profiles with different team, then one set in your project.

      If you leave it empty the project defined team will be used.

      (optional) The configuration to use. By default your Scheme
      defines which configuration (Debug, Release, ...) should be used,
      but you can overwrite it with this option.
      **Make sure that the Configuration you specify actually exists
      in your Xcode Project**. If it does not, if you have a typo
      in the value of this input Xcode will simply use the Configuration
      specified by the Scheme and will silently ignore this parameter!

      URLs of the certificates to download.

      Multiple URLs can be specified, separated by a pipe (`|`) character.

      You can specify a local path as well, using the `file://` scheme.

      Provide a development certificate url, to ensure development code sign files for the project and also provide a distribution certificate url, to ensure distribution code sign files for your project.

      Example: 

      `file://./development/certificate/path|https://distribution/certificate/url`

      Certificate passphrases.

      Multiple passphrases can be specified, separated by a pipe (`|`) character.

      Specified certificate passphrase count should match the count of the certificate urls.

      example: development certificate with empty passphrase, distribution certificate with non-empty passphrase

      ```
      passphrases: "|distribution-passphrase"
